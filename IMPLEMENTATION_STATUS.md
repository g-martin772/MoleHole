## Overview
This document tracks the implementation status of the multi-threading architecture for MoleHole as outlined in MULTITHREADING_PLAN.md.

## Implementation Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Infrastructure (COMPLETE)
**Status:** Fully implemented and integrated  
**Commit:** d3664e3

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created `src/Threading/` directory structure
- ✅ Implemented `ThreadSafeQueue<T>` with condition variables and shutdown support
- ✅ Implemented `TripleBuffer<T>` for lock-free scene synchronization
- ✅ Implemented command types (`RenderCommand`, `SimulationCommand`, `LoadRequest`)
- ✅ Created `ThreadManager` class with lifecycle management
- ✅ Updated `CMakeLists.txt` to include Threading sources
- ✅ Verified successful build

**Files Added:**
- `src/Threading/CommandTypes.h`
- `src/Threading/ThreadSafeQueue.h`
- `src/Threading/TripleBuffer.h`
- `src/Threading/ThreadManager.h`
- `src/Threading/ThreadManager.cpp`

**Key Features:**

### ✅ Phase 2: Resource Loader (COMPLETE)
**Status:** Basic implementation complete (synchronous loading)  
**Commits:** fa721a2, 8e909f4

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created `MeshCache` with `std::shared_mutex` (readers-writer lock)
- ✅ Implemented `ResourceLoader` class
- ✅ Added synchronous mesh loading capability
- ✅ Integrated `ResourceLoader` with `ThreadManager`
- ✅ Integrated `ThreadManager` into `Application` lifecycle
- ✅ Verified successful build and initialization

**Files Added:**
- `src/Threading/ResourceLoader.h`
- `src/Threading/ResourceLoader.cpp`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/Threading/ThreadManager.h` - Added ResourceLoader integration
- `src/Threading/ThreadManager.cpp` - Initialize/shutdown ResourceLoader

- `src/Application/Application.cpp` - Initialize/shutdown ThreadManager

**Key Features:**
- Thread-safe mesh cache using shared_mutex
- ResourceLoader integrated into application lifecycle
- ThreadManager properly initialized and shut down
- Foundation ready for async loading in Phase 3

**Note:** Current implementation uses synchronous loading. Full async implementation with dedicated loader thread will be added in Phase 4.

### ✅ Phase 3: Viewport Render Thread (COMPLETE)
**Status:** Fully implemented and integrated  
**Commit:** 87fa37e

**Completed:**

- `src/Threading/ThreadManager.h` - Added ViewportRenderThread integration
- `src/Threading/ThreadManager.cpp` - Initialize/shutdown viewport thread
- `src/Application/Application.cpp` - Pass main context to ThreadManager

**Key Features:**
- Shared OpenGL context for resource sharing with main thread
- Double-buffered FBOs for smooth rendering without tearing
- Atomic `std::atomic<GLuint>` for lock-free texture access
- Thread-safe viewport resizing with pending resize flag
- Clean startup and shutdown with proper context cleanup

**Current Limitations:**
- Actual scene rendering not yet implemented (test render shows animated clear color)
- Scene access via triple buffer pending (Phase 4)
- Camera synchronization via RenderCommand works but not fully utilized

**Estimated Effort:** 2 days (completed)

### 🚧 Phase 4: Simulation Thread (NOT STARTED)
**Status:** Pending implementation

**TODO:**
- [ ] Integrate triple buffer with Scene class
- [ ] Implement simulation thread function
- [ ] Move `Simulation::Update()` logic to simulation thread
- [ ] Implement scene copying for triple buffer

- [ ] Synchronize simulation state with UI
- [ ] Handle start/stop/pause commands
- [ ] Test simulation at 60 Hz independent of rendering

**Key Challenges:**
- Scene copy performance (need to verify < 10 microseconds)
- Animation graph thread safety
- Simulation time management
- State synchronization between threads

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

### 🚧 Phase 5: Integration & Optimization (NOT STARTED)
**Status:** Pending implementation

**TODO:**
- [ ] Add performance metrics collection
- [ ] Implement thread metrics display in UI
- [ ] Add frame time histograms

- [ ] Add configurable thread priorities
- [ ] Handle window resize gracefully
- [ ] Implement proper shutdown sequence
- [ ] Stress test with 100+ objects
- [ ] Run valgrind memory leak check
- [ ] Profile with Tracy or similar tool

**Key Challenges:**
- Performance measurement without impacting performance
- Thread scheduling and priority management
- Graceful degradation under heavy load
- Cross-platform testing

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 4)
1. Implement scene copying for triple buffer
2. Create simulation thread with proper scene synchronization
3. Move Simulation::Update() to dedicated thread
4. Test scene updates flowing from simulation → render → UI

### Short Term (Phase 5)
1. Add performance metrics collection
2. Implement thread monitoring UI
3. Optimize scene copying with dirty flags
4. Stress test the system

### Medium Term (Future Enhancements)
1. Async resource loading with priority queue
2. GPU-side physics simulation
3. Network rendering support
4. Replay system

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
- ViewportRenderThread renders test pattern (animated clear color) instead of actual scene
- Scene rendering still happens on main thread via Renderer::RenderScene()
- Simulation still runs on main thread
- No performance metrics or monitoring yet
- ResourceLoader performs synchronous loading (no performance benefit)

### Architectural Decisions
- Triple buffering uses 3x scene memory (~9KB for typical scene)
- Scene copy must complete in < 10 microseconds (to be validated in Phase 4)
- OpenGL 4.6 required for shared contexts
- Linux-only currently (X11 + GTK dependencies)

| Simulation Update Time | < 16ms (60 FPS) | 🔄 TBD |
| Scene Copy Time | < 10 μs | 🔄 TBD |
| Sim→Render Latency | < 1 frame | 🔄 TBD |
